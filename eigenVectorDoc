For eigen vector plot, we use 2 least correlated eigen vector in the top 3 eigen vector(the absulote value of eigen values that are top 3 largest). We could see that some graph clearly taken on eigenSpoke pattern.
Eigen vector could be used to find closely connected nodes like Bipartite-graph and cliques. From graph we infer that one of the important causes for a spokes pattern is the presence of a large number of tightly knit communities in the graph(Cited from the eigenSpoke paper from Ukang).We could see that email-EuALl, as-skitter.ungraph-75000, cit-HepTh , soc-digg, soc-Youtube-75000.undir, soc-flickr-75000 has clear eigenspoke pattern, indicating that they have clear comunities structures. Take the youtube as an example, many users form disconnected friend circle. Some users like korea soap opera may never like game series like dota and legend of leagues. On other graph like soft-jdkdependency, we could not see the clear spoke structure, this might because that jdkdependency has a unique-root tree structure that makes the whole graph connected. Other graphs like bio-protein-undir, nodes are completely scattered on the plane, indicating that no clear community structure is in the graph.
