\begin{algorithm}[h]
\KwIn{table, integer}
The core size k
The node connection graph,``GM\_TABLE\_UNDIRECT", that consists of: src\_id , target\_id \\
\KwOut{table}
A k-core graph that consists of: node id \\
%\nl \bf Pass\;
{\bf procedure:} \\
Create at tmp table that store the node-id and indegree count\\
{\bf While} the size tmp table still changes: \\
	~~~ find the node that the indegree is less than k \\
	~~~ remove the nodes from the ``GM\_TABLE\_UNDIRECT" \\
	~~~ calculate the tmp table again \\
output unique src\_id  \\
compute the weak component again
