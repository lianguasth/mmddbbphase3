\par In this project, we learned that SQL can be effectively used to implement various graph algorithm. By implementing K-Core algorithm based on the framework provided by Graphminer, we got hands-on experience with SQL programming and deeper understanding of several graph algorithms, including the concept and implementation of degree distribution, PageRank, weakly connected components, radius and eigenvector. By experimenting with various index settings, we got a quantitive understanding of the benefits of index in complex SQL-based algorithms. By analyzing the results and plots of these graph algorithms, we identified the prevalence of power law and learned to use domain-specific knowledge to explain distinct patterns in various graph attributes.
